This is a brief guide to customize using the Comment Rating internal
functions.  These functions are accessible globaly as soon as the
plugin is enabled.

1. To access the rating of a comment:
   To avoid duplicated database access, Comment Rating use an cache
   "$ck_cache" hash array, defined as,
      $ck_cache = array('ck_ips'=>"", 'ck_comment_id'=>0, 'ck_rating_up'=>0, 'ck_rating_down'=>0)
   You should use it as a global variable. Here's the code.
      global $ck_cache;
      ckrating_get_rating($comment_ID);

   Then, all the related content will be accessible.
      $ck_cache['ck_comment_id']
      $ck_cache['ck_ips'] 
      $ck_cache['ck_rating_up'] 
      $ck_cache['ck_rating_down'] 


2. If you want to do tight integration with your theme in placement
and style, you will need to insert the following  line into your
theme "comments.php" file within the comment loop.

<?php  if(function_exists(ckrating_display_karma)) { ckrating_display_karma(); } ?>


3. Order comments by their rating.
   Configure the value for "comment_karma" field (Likes, Dislikes or
   Both) in Comment Rating Options.  Then use the following code to
   retrieve comments for a specific post.

   If your theme uses wp_list_comments(), use the following
      if (function_exists(ckrating_get_comments)) {
         $post_id = $post->ID;
         $mycomments = ckrating_get_comments("post_id=$post_id&status=approve&orderby=comment_karma&order=DESC");
      }
      else
         $mycomments = null;
      wp_list_comments(array(), $mycomments);

   Otherwise, use the following,

      $post_id = $post->ID;
      if (function_exists(ckrating_get_comments)) 
         $comments = ckrating_get_comments("post_id=$post_id&status=approve&orderby=comment_karma&order=DESC");
      else
         $comments = get_comments("post_id=$post_id&status=approve&order=DESC");

      foreach($comments as $comm) :
         echo($comm->comment_author);
      endforeach;

4. If you want to style the comment images and text, you can define a CSS class in
   your style file "CommentRating".  For example, the following will
   show the comment rating images and text on the right.

   .CommentRating {
      text-align: right;
      float: right;
   }

5. Another problem which could cause display icons and numbers in
each line is caused by "display: block"

.commentlist small {
	margin-bottom: 5px;
	display: block;
	font-size: 87%;
}
